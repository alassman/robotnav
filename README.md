Robot Navigation
This code was created to be robot independent, and has been tested with several robot platforms. The way I achieved this is by using Object Oriented Programing. The current software contains code that can be used immediately with the Lego Mindstorms EV3 kit. More details at http://www.robotnav.com/software/
